The following is list of requirement for developing user modules:

	a) A linux linux development environment
	b) A V3 router that is on the same network as your development environment
	c) A username and password for this router

Download the SDK from dev.bb-elec.com to your working environment and untar
using:
		tar -zxf bbsdk.tar.gz

This creates a directory called bbsdk that contains everything you need to 
start making your own user modules

In this directory the is a script called install.sh that is used to download
the latest version of the API from our devzone, update any necessary files 
locally, and update the API on the router you are using to develop.
To run this script just:
		cd bbsdk
		./install.sh

Then enter your device IP address, username, and password as prompted.
